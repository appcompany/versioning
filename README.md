# OneZero Versioning Action

> Welcome to OneZero's versioning tool! :rocket:

#### Project description

The versioning tool can be used to version both front- and backend software. While it roughly follow semantic versioning, it has been adapted to better suite software platforms like the App Store.

The tool consists out of two parts:

- GitHub Action that runs on each commit to a branch and can be run on PR's
- CLI tool / script that should be run before each commit that checks the commit message

### Usage Guide
